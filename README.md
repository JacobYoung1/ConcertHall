# ConcertHall
This is a simulation of a ConcertHall with the ability to visit a TicketBooth, ConcessionStand, and the ConcertHall
itself when visiting the Ticketer. The txt files are where you can set up the specifics of what performances there are,
what concession items are on sale, and the date of where you start.
